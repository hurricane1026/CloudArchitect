**Blob Storage**: Binary Large Object storage for unstructured data.

**Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolation technique to prevent cascading failures.

## C

**CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Distributed network of servers for delivering content.

**CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.

**Circuit Breaker**: Pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services.

**Cloud Native**: Applications designed specifically for cloud environments.
